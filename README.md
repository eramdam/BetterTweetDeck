# Better TweetDeck

Adds some nice options on [TweetDeck](http://tweetdeck.twitter.com) to provide a better experience on the webapp when used on Chrome (and Opera, but it's unsupported).

# Installation (Chrome)

+ [Better TweetDeck on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-tweetdeck/micblkellenpbfapmcpcfhcoeohhnpob)

# Installation (Opera)

Better TweetDeck has been proven to work on Opera using the [Download Chrome Extension](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9/?display=en) add-on. Follow those steps to install Better TweetDeck on Opera :

1. Download "[Download Chrome Extension](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9/?display=en)"
2. Get [Better TweetDeck on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-tweetdeck/micblkellenpbfapmcpcfhcoeohhnpob)
3. Install it like you would on Chrome
4. Confirm the installation because Opera will freak out about the origin of the extension
5. ???
6. PROFIT !!! :tada: 

**Reminder**: Even if it's working as I type those lines, the extension could be broken under Opera, and I will **not** care about it as it's a non-official and un-supported solution
